# DataScience / Machine-Learning Projects

## About
This Repository consists of all the data science and machine learning projects.
There will be always room for improvement and I will be constantly updating this folder.
Currently folder contains only supervised machine learning models.

## Overview

All datasets that have been used will be included in folder and detailed description of each project under them.
