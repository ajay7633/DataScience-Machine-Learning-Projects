# Independent Study - NBA Player Data

## Overview

This project is an independent study on how the trend has changed in Basketball play style affected players over the last 35 years
and how their salary has been affected by the change in play style. 


## Study

In the earlier years, Teams were most likely to draft a center (or big man), but that trend changed over the last decade as more and more teams are more inclined to draft a guard or a forward. 
This is already a well-known fact as the average 3pt shot in-game has gone since the start of the NBA and is high. But this study also confirms the fact that teams 
are more likely to pay a guard or forward than a big man.

## Plots
Figure 1: Line Plot
It shows the trend in the mean salary of position category over the 1985 -2018 seasons. The average wage, which dropped in recent years, has picked up recently.
This increase is due to recent tv deals that have seen a spike in players' pay. We can see some spikes in salary in certain categories than others. It may seems as though the big men
are paid more but looking at next few figures will bring about a more clear picture.
